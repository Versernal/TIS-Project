This is a web application for our Intro to Software Engineering. 

This is just a mock up of our web app: Classroom Inventory Supplies.

It's suppose to be a program for teachers to use to keep track of their supplies, as well as a way for teachers to
request supplies to administrators directly. Administrators will then be able to keep track of all requests and either
approve or deny them. 

We have hardcoded a Teacher user login:
Username: teacher@gmail.com\
Password: Teacher123!

We also have hardocoded a Administrator user login:
Username: administrator@gmail.com
Password: Admin123

As of now, our program is nit picky with the way you type in the username, but with more time and work it would be more
lenient about lowercase or uppwercase letters.

Our program doesn't have a database, but in the future it would have some in order to keep track of users and requests.
